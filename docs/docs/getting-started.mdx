# ✨ Getting Started

**Robo.js** is a powerful framework for building epic Discord experiences.

It lets you **[reduce boilerplate](./robojs/files)**, **[add features instantly](./robojs/plugins)**, **[follow best practices](./robojs/sage)**, **[deploy with ease](./hosting/overview)**, **[automate tasks](./discord-activities/tunnels)**, **[persist data](./robojs/flashcore)**, **[debug inline](./discord-bots/debug)**, **[share features](./create-robo/plugins)**, **[manage state](./robojs/state)**, **[stay organized](./robojs/modules)**, **[join an ecosystem](./templates/overview)**, and **[so much more](./robojs/overview)**. All for **[less than 700kB](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=robo.js)**.

Best of all, **[it works with your existing code](./discord-bots/migrate)**. You may even find it fun!

## Quick Start

The best way to create a Robo.js project is with **[create-robo](./create-robo/overview)** in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName>
```

This will spawn a new **Robo.js** project ready to use. We call these **Robos**.
