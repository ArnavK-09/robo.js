# Plugins Overview

Plugins in Robo.js are powerful, yet simple to use enhancements to your Robo. They are NPM packages that can be installed with a single command and "just work" as if they were part of Robo.js itself.

```bash
npx robo add <package>
```

They can add new features, modify existing ones, or provide additional functionality to your Robo. Plugins can be developed by anyone and published to the NPM registry for others to use.

These docs provide an overview of the official plugins developed by the Robo.js team. Each plugin has its own page with detailed information on how to install and use it in your Robo project.
