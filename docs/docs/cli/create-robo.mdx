# âš¡ Create Robo

The `create-robo` interactive CLI is your go-to for kickstarting fresh Robo.js projects and plugins! It's a nifty standalone tool that won't bloat your project, and it'll hold your hand through the setup process like a pro.

## New Robo

Ready to create a project named "my-awesome-robo"? Here's how:

```bash
npx create-robo my-awesome-robo
```

Once you're in, the CLI will walk you through three easy-peasy steps:

1. TypeScript or nah? (yes/no)
2. Choose your features! (ESLint, Prettier, Plugins - mix and match, or skip 'em all!)
3. Pop in your Discord token and client id. Wanna skip it? Just press enter, but remember to edit your `.env` file later.

## New Plugin

Got your eyes on crafting a plugin? Run the CLI with the `--plugin` option:

```bash
npx create-robo my-awesome-plugin --plugin
```

This will guide you through two simple steps:

1. TypeScript or nah? (yes/no)
2. Choose your features! (ESLint, Prettier)

## Options

Feeling adventurous? This CLI's got options for ya:

- `-f`, `--features <features>` comma-separated list of features to include
- `--js`, `--javascript` create a Robo using JavaScript
- `-k`, `--kit` choose a kit to start off with your Robo
- `-ni`, `--no-install` skips the installation of dependencies
- `-nu`, `--no-update` skips the update check
- `-P`, `--plugin` lets you craft a plugin project instead of a full-fledged Robo
