# Discord Activities Overview

Robo.js is a powerful framework that allows you to create Discord activities with ease, **[among other things](../discord-bots/overview)**. This section will explain all the concepts behind **[Discord Activities](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)**, and how they are simplified with Robo.js.

## Getting Started

Ready to embark on this adventure? Creating a Discord Activity with Robo.js is as easy as running one command.

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName> --kit activity
```

This will walk you through setting up your project and installing the necessary dependencies. Once selected, you can run and start developing your Discord Activity right away!

## What are Discord Activities?

Discord Activities are interactive experiences that users can engage with on Discord. They can be games, quizzes, or any other type of interactive content that users can play with. Basically, they are mini web apps that run inside Discord via iframes!

Just like a regular web app, Discord Activities are built using **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. You can use any front-end framework you like, such as **[React](https://react.dev/)**, **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/)**, **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**, or none at all. The only difference is that you need to use **[Discord's Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord's APIs.

## How does Robo.js help?

Robo.js simplifies the process of creating Discord Activities by providing a file-based structure, an integrated database, TypeScript support, and a multitude of plugin-powered skills to unlock along the way. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.

Here's what you can expect:

- **[Single Project](../robojs/files)**: Everything is in one place, making it easy to manage. No need to set up separate backend and frontend projects then connect them together.
- **[Integrated Database](../robojs/flashcore)**: Robo.js comes with an optional integrated database, so you don't have to worry about setting up a database server. You can store data directly in your project, or using an external database of your choice via adapters.
- **[TypeScript Support](../create-robo/typescript)**: TypeScript works out of the box, so you can use it without any additional setup.
- **[Built-in Tunnels](./tunnels)**: The Robo.js CLI automatically sets up free Cloudflare tunnels for easy testing.
- **[Plugin System](../plugins/overview)**: Robo.js has a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend your project with additional features. Because of the file-based structure, plugins seamlessly integrate with your project's backend and frontend alike.
- **[Easy Hosting](../hosting/overview)**: Robo.js makes it easy to deploy your project to the web. Just run `robo deploy` and your project will be live for others to use in seconds.
- **[Ecosystem](../plugins/overview)**: Robo.js has a growing ecosystem of plugins, templates, and tools to help you build your project faster and more powerful with less effort.

## Documentation
