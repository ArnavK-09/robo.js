# ✨ Getting Started with Discord Activities

**[Robo.js](https://github.com/Wave-Play/robo.js)** allows you to create **[Discord Activities](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4422142836759-Activities-on-Discord)** with ease, among **[other things](../getting-started)**.

**Discord Activities** are web apps that run inside Discord and can be built using **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)**, **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)**, and **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)**. They use **[Discord's Embedded App SDK](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk/)** to interact with Discord APIs.

## Quick Start

Ready to start your adventure? Try **[create-robo](./create-robo/overview)** in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-robo <projectName> -k activity
```

This will walk you through setting up your project and installing the necessary dependencies. Once selected, you can run and start developing your **Discord Activity** right away!

## How does Robo.js help?

**Robo.js** simplifies the process by providing features and an ecosystem of plugins to help you build your **Discord Activity** faster and more efficiently.

Here's what you can expect:

- **[One Project](../robojs/files)**: Everything is in one place, making it easy to manage. No more separate backend and frontend projects.
- **[Integrated Database](../robojs/flashcore)**: Robo.js has an built-in KV database that can be pointed to any data source via adapters.
- **[TypeScript Support](../create-robo/typescript)**: TypeScript works out of the box, so you can use it without any setup.
- **[Built-in Tunnels](./tunnels)**: The Robo CLI automatically sets up free Cloudflare tunnels for easy testing.
- **[Plugin System](../plugins/overview)**: Extend your activity's features with plugins that integrate seamlessly.
- **[Easy Hosting](../hosting/overview)**: Deploy your activity for others to use with just one command, or self-host it on your own.
- **[Ecosystem](../plugins/overview)**: A growing ecosystem of plugins, templates, and tools to help you build faster with less effort.

## Documentation
